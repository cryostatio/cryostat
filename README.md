# Cryostat3

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Container Engines

Development on this project is primarily done using `podman`, though things *should* generally work when using `docker`
as well. For ease and convenience it is suggested to use `podman` with the following configurations:

```bash
$ systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

`~/.bashrc` (or equivalent shell configuration)
```bash
$ export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock
$ export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
```

```bash
$ sudo dnf install podman-docker
```

## Prerequisites

```bash
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
$ cd src/main/webui
$ yarn install && yarn yarn:frzinstall
$ cd -
```

```bash
$ sh db/build.sh
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```bash
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

or

```bash
$ quarkus dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8181/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```bash
$ ./mvnw package
```

or

```bash
$ quarkus build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```bash
$ ./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```bash
$ ./mvnw package -Pnative
```

or

```bash
$ quarkus build --native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```bash
$ ./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/cryostat3-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## Manual Smoketesting

The shortest feedback loop during active development is to use Quarkus dev mode, ie `quarkus dev` from earlier.
This will run Cryostat as a local JVM process hooked up to its frontend, and required companion services in containers.
Any changes made to the backend or frontend sources, `application.properties`, `pom.xml`, etc. will trigger
automatic rebuilds and live-coding.

The next testing step is to build and package Cryostat into a container and run it as a container.

```bash
$ quarkus build ; podman image prune -f
$ sh smoketest.sh
```

This will build the container image, then spin it up along with required services within a Podman pod.
Data is persisted between runs in Podman volumes.

To make containers' names DNS-resolvable from the host machine, do:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/figiel/hosts libuserhosts
$ cd libuserhosts
$ make
$ mkdir -p ~/bin
$ cp libuserhosts.so ~/bin
$ echo 'export LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so' >> ~/.bashrc
$ export LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so
```

You can verify that this setup works by running `smoketest.sh`, and then in another terminal:
```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so ping cryostat
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so curl http://cryostat:8181
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so firefox http://cryostat:8181
```

The next testing step is to run this same container setup in k8s.

```bash
$ cd smoketest/k8s
$ sh smoketest.sh kind # if you use `kind` and want to spin up a cluster, otherwise skip this if you have another cluster accessible via `kubectl`
$ IMAGE_REPOSITORY=$QUAY_USERNAME sh smoketest.sh generate apply
$ sh smoketest.sh forward # if you need to use port-forwarding to get access to the cluster's services
```
