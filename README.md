A container-native JVM application which acts as a bridge to other containerized JVMs and exposes a secure API for producing, analyzing, and retrieving JDK Flight Recorder data from your cloud workloads.

  what you've read so far sounds interesting and you want to know more as a
  **user**, rather than as a _developer_. Here you will find instructions on
  how to install Cryostat using the

  configure your applications to enable connectivity, and how to use the

  complement to JFR. Some parts of JMC are borrowed and re-used to form the basis of
  Cryostat. JMC is still a recommended tool for more full-featured analysis of JFR
  files beyond what Cryostat currently implements.

  application which supports reading JFR files

This repository contains the source code for Cryostat versions 3.0 and later. Cryostat (née "container-jfr") versions prior to 3.0
are located at [cryostatio/cryostat-legacy](https://github.com/cryostatio/cryostat-legacy). Container images from both are published
to the same [`quay.io`](https://quay.io/repository/cryostat/cryostat) repository.

## BUILD

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

### Setup Dependencies

For ease and convenience, it is suggested to use `podman` with the following configurations:

```bash
$ systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

`$HOME/.bashrc` (or equivalent shell configuration)
```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock
```

`$HOME/.testcontainers.properties`
```properties
ryuk.container.privileged=true
docker.client.strategy=org.testcontainers.dockerclient.UnixSocketClientProviderStrategy
testcontainers.reuse.enable=false
```

Initialize submodules before building:

```bash
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
$ cd src/main/webui
$ yarn install && yarn yarn:frzinstall
$ cd -
```

### Build the application container image

The application image can be created using:

```bash
# With Maven
$ ./mvnw package
# Or with Quarkus CLI
$ quarkus build
```

### Build and run the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```bash
# With Maven
$ ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
# Or with Quarkus CLI
$ quarkus dev
```

This will run Cryostat as a local JVM process hooked up to its frontend, and required companion services in containers. Any changes made to the backend or frontend sources, `application.properties`, `pom.xml`, etc. will trigger automatic rebuilds and live-coding.

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8181/q/dev/.

### Run the application with dev mode frontend

You can run the server setup with a live coding frontend instance using:

`terminal 1`
```bash
$ ./smoktest.bash -t
```

`terminal 2`
```bash
$ cd /path/to/cryostat-web # this can be ./src/main/webui , or a separate clone of the cryostat-web repository
$ yarn yarn:frzinstall
$ yarn start:dev
```

This will run Cryostat, required companion services, and test applications in a podman/docker compose container setup. Changes to frontend sources in `/path/to/cryostat-web` will trigger automatic rebuilds and live-coding of the web UI only. This is often useful for frontend development compared to the previous dev mode setup, since it allows for the full suite of test applications to be deployed.

The Quarkus Dev UI is not available in this setup.

## RUN

### Local Smoketesting

Development on this project is primarily done using `podman`, though things should generally work when using `docker` as well.
Ensure you have performed the `podman` setup above first, then build the container image and run smoketests.
This will spin up the cryostat container and its required services.

```bash
# build Cryostat container, clean up any dangling container images/layers
$ ./mvnw package ; podman image prune -f
# alternatively, use Quarkus CLI instead of the Maven wrapper
$ quarkus build ; podman image prune -f
# check the available smoketest options
$ bash smoketest.bash -h
# run a smoketest scenario
$ bash smoketest.bash -O # without the -O flag, the smoketest will pull the latest development image version, rather than the one you just built
```

To make containers' names DNS-resolvable from the host machine, do:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/figiel/hosts libuserhosts
$ cd libuserhosts
$ make PREFIX=$HOME/bin all install
$ echo 'export LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/lib/libuserhosts.so' >> ~/.bashrc
$ export LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/lib/libuserhosts.so
```
(this will require a C compiler toolchain present on your development machine)

You can verify that this setup works by running `smoketest.bash`, and then in another terminal:
```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so ping auth
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so curl http://auth:8080
$ LD_PRELOAD=$HOME/bin/libuserhosts.so firefox http://auth:8080
```
